    <li> "npm i" to install all packages</li>
    <li> "npm run start" to start nodemon server</li>
</ol>

### Run Frontend
Built using React Native. Run the following commands into the terminal:
<ol>
    <li> "cd" into the project directory and then "cd ./app/"</li>
    <li> "npm i" to install all packages</li>
    <li> Ensure that an android virtual device is available on the local machine with SDK of 24 and above
